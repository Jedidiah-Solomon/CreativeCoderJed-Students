#Day One Answers
##Differentiate between a Library and Framework

Frameworks are sets of pre-written, pre-integrated code modules that make the process of developing software easier. Frameworks facilitate the rapid, effective, and error-free development of software. e.g is Django, using frameworks. Certain frameworks concentrate on specific languages for programming, such as Python, C++, or Java.

On the other hand,Â a library is a collection of software available to all users. A variety of systems and applications can be developed. E.g React.js, Axios, Jquery.

In short, libraries are tools one use, while frameworks provide a structure that one adhere to.
