# GitHub-Collabo - Student Collaboration Project

Welcome Students!
[Welcome Your self guys](https://creative-coder-jed-students.vercel.app/)
This project is part of the @CreativeCoderJed-Students community. Here, we will be working together on various GitHub projects, and everything we do will be reflected in our Discord server. This way, we can stay connected, track our progress, and collaborate effectively.

## How It Works

GitHub Integration: Whenever you commit, push, or open a pull request in this repository, a notification will automatically be sent to our Discord channel.
Real-Time Collaboration: As soon as you make changes, all team members will be able to see it in Discord, so everyone stays updated with the latest activity.
Keep it Transparent: Every step of the work you do‚Äîwhether it's a new feature, bug fix, or review‚Äîwill be shared with your peers in Discord to ensure transparency and help you get feedback quickly.

## Getting Started

Here‚Äôs how you can start contributing to this collaborative project:

1. Fork the Repository

2. Clone Your Fork
   Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CreativeCoderJed-Students.git
3. Create a New Branch
   Always work on a new branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
   In this project our branch patter is **name-program registered** e.g solomon-software_development,solomon-data_analysis,solomon-digital_marketing,solomon-all

4. Make Your Changes
   Feel free to contribute new features, fix bugs, or work on any task given to you.

## For projects that have to do with merging to main

1. Open a Pull Request
   Once you‚Äôre done, open a pull request from your repository to the main repository so that admin can review your changes. All PRs will trigger notifications in Discord!
